# Internet Voting Intergration Testing Framework README
## Author: Charlie Hall

To allow intergration testing easily I developed a python testing framework as outlined here. ```runner.py``` handles the creation of nodes and the passing of input, test cases will only examine the logs generated by the ```logger.py``` class in the server, test cases will not interact of pass input to the server directly.

### Intergration testing instructions
#### Running tests
The test runner is used to execute tests and can be used to run all tests or individual tests

To run all tests execute in a terminal:
```python runner.py```

To run a specific test usexecute in a terminal
```python runner.py --test-name <TEST_NAME_HERE>```

#### Creating test cases
Test cases must first start with a parameter variable, this must follow a similar format as below, the node's port is indicated and wether the node is a bootstrap node. The input parameter the sequest of commands passed to the node.
```python
params = {
    "1" : {
        "port" : 8000, "bootstrap" : 1, "input":"pause 2\nquit"
    }
}

def test_case():
    pass
```
The examining of the logs will be preformed in a main function similar to 'test_case' shown here.

```python
from cases.test_testcase import test_cast, params as test_case_params


testcases = [
    ("test1" , test_cast, test_case_params)
]
```

test cases must be manually imported and indicated in the runner file as shown above.
